# Image Segmentation of Microscope Images with U-Net - Machine Learning 2020
Authors: Andrea Oliveri, CÃ©lina Chkroun, Bernardo Conde

# Introduction
This repository hosts our canonical implementation and training of a Neural Network called [`U-Net`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597).
`U-Net` is a neural network with the special purpose of segmentating various neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks.
We perform various types of analysis and different training regiments in order to test the network's robustness against multiple
types of image artifacts.

# Folder Structure
- `Model`: where all the important information for the trained model should be, saved in the `ProtoBuffer` format.

- `Scripts`: contains all the `Python3` code files. In this folder there are multiple important files:
  - `UNET Train.ipynb` is a `Jupyter` notebook where all the training of the `U-Net` takes place
  
  - `UNET Distortions Evaluate.ipynb` is a `Jupyter` notebook where multiple evaluations of the trained network are done,
  mostly recording how well the network performs with artificially altered images
  
  - `distortions.py` contains all the methods used to alter the testing images
  
  - `model.py` is where our canonical implementation of the `U-Net` resides
  
  - `utils.py` contains simple helper functions to make the rest of the project easier to work with
  
# Dependencies
Our project depends on `python3`, `numpy`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, `notebook`, `opencv-python`, `tenserflow >= 2.0.0`, `scipy.ndimage`
